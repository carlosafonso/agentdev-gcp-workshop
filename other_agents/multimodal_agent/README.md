# An ADK agent with multi-modal input and output

1. From the `other_agents` folder, run the following command in your terminal to start the ADK web UI:

```bash
adk web
```

2. Ensure that the `multimodal_agent` agent is selected in the dropdown.
3. Click the **Upload local file** button (the one with the paperclip icon) and upload a picture of an aircraft, such as the one included in the `sample_images` folder. Then send the message to the agent.
4. The agent should reply with the same image, but the aircraft livery should be changed to that of the airline's main competitor.
